Numbers Game

Welcome to Numbers Game, a multiplayer game where players compete to choose the best number based on a strategic calculation. This repository contains all components of the game, including the Flask server, Web frontend, Android Host App, and Android Library.

📌 Project Overview

The game follows these rules:

Players join the game by scanning a QR code from the Android host app.

Each player picks a number between 0 and 100.

The average of all chosen numbers is calculated and multiplied by 0.8.

The player whose number is closest to this result wins the round.

The game continues for multiple rounds, and the player with the most round wins is the overall winner.
